<!DOCTYPE html><!-- This page is a placeholder for generated extensions api doc. Note:
    1) The <head> information in this page is significant, should be uniform
       across api docs and should be edited only with knowledge of the
       templating mechanism.
    3) All <body>.innerHTML is genereated as an rendering step. If viewed in a
       browser, it will be re-generated from the template, json schema and
       authored overview content.
    4) The <body>.innerHTML is also generated by an offline step so that this
       page may easily be indexed by search engines.

Also, the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow you to

<h2 id="using">How to use experimental APIs</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure you're using either
    <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs'" tppabs="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs">Canary</a>
    (which you can use at the same time as other Chrome channels) or the
<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel'" tppabs="http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel">Dev channel</a>.
    Although the experimental APIs might work in other versions,
    we need your feedback on the latest incarnation of the APIs,
    which you can find in Canary and on the Dev channel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using either the
    <a href="experimental-2.html" tppabs="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/experimental.html">most recent API documentation</a> (if you're using Canary) or the
    <a href="experimental-1.html" tppabs="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/experimental.html">API documentation for the Dev channel</a>,
    write the code for your extension.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specify the "experimental"
    <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/manifest.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/manifest.html#permissions'" tppabs="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/manifest.html#permissions">permission</a>
    in your extension's manifest, like this:
<pre>"permissions": [
  <b>"experimental"</b>,
  ...
],
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable the experimental API in your browser.
    You can do this in either of two ways:
    <ul>
      <li> Go to <b>chrome://flags</b>,
        find "Experimental Extension APIs",
        click its "Enable" link,
        and restart Chrome.
        From now on,
        unless you return to that page and disable experimental APIs,
        you'll be able to run extensions that use experimental APIs.
      </li>
      <li> Specify the <b>--enable-experimental-extension-apis</b> flag
        each time you launch the browser.
        On Windows, you can do this by modifying
        the properties of the shortcut that you use to launch Google Chrome.
        For example:

<pre><em>path_to_chrome.exe</em> <b>--enable-experimental-extension-apis</b></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/topics  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/topics'" tppabs="http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/topics">Give us feedback!</a>
    Your comments and suggestions help us
    improve the APIs and decide
    which ones should move from experimental to supported.
